# Result

Results are a return type used in cases where an operation can succeed or fail, and, in either case, have an associated value of a generic type. It is an alternative error-handling approach to exceptions, particularly useful when it is common for an action to fail fairly often and failure does not qualify as an exception. With exceptions being a native error-handling mechanism, Results are not ideal for every use case.
